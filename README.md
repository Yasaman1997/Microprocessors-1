AVR ATmega16 Microcontroller programming and simulation using AtmelStudio and Proteus.

# Introduction: Instruction Set and Addressing Modes
The following is a quick start on basic concepts of ATmega16 microcontroller.

# Introduction: Instruction Set
This is a set of instructions for ATmega16 microcontroller which decides what operations the microcontroller can perform. Each instruction can control some parts of microcontroller.

# Introduction: Addressing Modes
Instructions can be categorized based on **how they access data** and **how they perform operations** on those data. This category consist of about 10 modes that controls this access and operation.

# Introduction: Instruction Format
Each instruction in ATmega16 consists of two parts:
* Opcode: Indicates to ALU what to do.
* Operands: Numbers on which the ALU operates.

# ATmega16 Addressing Modes Details
There are 5 sections in ATmega16 which have relationships with **data and program**. So the addressing mode category will spread over these 5 areas and they are mentioned down here:
* Register File (32 Registers - A part of SRAM which is built into the CPU - **32** bytes | 32 registers of 1 Byte)
* I/O Registers (64 Registers - A part of SRAM which is built into the CPU - **64** bytes | 64 registers of 1 Byte)
* SRAM (Data Memory - Separate from those mentioned above - out of CPU - **1024** Bytes considering 96 bytes for the above sections)
* EEPROM (**512** bytes)
* Flash Memory (AKA Program Memory - **16** Kbytes of On-chip In-system reprogrammable flash memory)

## Register Direct (Single Register) mode
<p align="center">

</p>

* Can operate on any 32 registers of the register file.

* Operations:
1. Read contents of registers 
2. Operate on contents
3. Store back in same register

* Usage examples:
1. **INC R0**
2. **DEC R5**
3. **LSL R9**


## Register Direct (Two Registers) mode
<p align="center">
  <img src="http://uupload.ir/files/7nky_register_direct(two_regs).png">
</p>

* Two registers are included in this mode:
1. Rs: Source Register
2. Rd: Destination Register

* Operations:
1. Read two registers
2. Operate on the content
3. Store the result in the destination register

* Usage Examples:
1. **ADD R1,R3**
2. **SUB R5,R7**

## Immediate mode
* Constant value is in the instruction.
* Operates on the register and that constant value and stores the result back in the register.
* Usage Examples:
1. **SUBI R4,8** (Subtract with Immediate: R4 = R4 - 8)
2. **ADIW R26,5** (Add Immediate to Word: R27:R26 = R27:R26 + 5)

## I/O direct mode
Instructions are used to access I/O space **(64 I/O registers)** but **not extended I/O registers**.
* Usage Examples:
1. **IN R10,PORTADDRESS**
2. **OUT PORTADDRESS,R10**
3. **IN Rd,PORTADDRESS**
4. **OUT PORTADDRESS,Rs**
* PORTADDRESS is between 0x00 to 0x3F
* Rs and Rd are any registers from register file

## Data direct mode
<p align="center">

</p>

Two word instructions are used in this mode. One of the words is the address of the data memory space.
* Usage Examples:
1. **STS K,Rs** (Store dircet SRAM - Put the Rs contents in place K - K is a 16 bit address)
2. **LDS Rd,K** (Load direct from SRAM - Grab the contents of place K in the SRAM and put it in the Rd register)


## Data indirect mode
<p align="center">
  <img src="http://uupload.ir/files/l6vn_data_indirect_mode.png">
</p>

It's similar to the data direct except that:
* It has one word only
* The address of the memory location is stored in register Y or Z
* Usage Examples:
1. **LD Rd,X+** (Load indirect with post increment: Rd = X , X = X + 1)
2. **ELD Rd,X** (Extended indirect load: Rd = R27:R26)
3. **LDD Rd,(Y+q)** (Load indirect with displacement: Rd = (Y+q) () are showing the contents)
4. **ST -Y,Rs**

## I/O Ports using indirect mode
I/O ports can be accessed using indirect SRAM commands.
* Usage Examples:
1. **LDI R16,HIGH(PORTB+32)**

## Extended I/O mode
For extended I/O registers, we cannot use commands like **IN** or **OUT**. Instead we need to use the direct and indirect SRAM access commands like LDS, STS, etc.
* Some important commands are:
1. **LDS** - Load from SRAM
2. **STS** - Store to SRAM 
3. **SBR** - Set bits in register
4. **CBR** - clear bits in register
5. **SBRS** - Skip if bit in register is set
6. **SBRC** - Skip if bit in register is clear

## Direct program memory addressing mode
Important command:
* Call: Call a subroutine and put the return address on the stack 
* Usage Example:
1. **CALL k** (This will do the following: first, STACK = PC + 1 and then, PC = k)

## Implicit addressing mode
Important commands: **CLC** and **RET**

## Indirect program addressing mode
<p align="center">
  <img src="http://uupload.ir/files/0tw_indirect_program_addressing_mode.png">
</p>
These instructions use Z register to point to the program memory.

1. **ICALL** (Indirect call to Z)
2. **IJMP** (Indirect jump to Z)

## Relative program addressing mode
<p align="center">
  <img src="http://uupload.ir/files/o1y_relative_program_addressing_mode.png">
</p>

Instructions in this addressing mode are **RCALL** and **RJMP** which are used with an offset to change the current position of program counter.
* Usage Example:
1. **RCALL k** (STACK = PC + 1 , PC = PC + k + 1)
2. **RJMP k** (PC = PC + k + 1)

# Useful Examples

# ATmega Programming
In this section I'll provide some good practices on programming an ATmega microcontroller in assembly language with AtmelStudio 7.

## Writing to EEPROM
This program is the first program I'll cover in these series. The objective is to write numbers 0-9 to the EEPROM Memory. In order to write the data into the EEPROM memory, we have to deal with some important registers:
* **EEARL** & **EEARH** (EEPROM Address Register - Low & High bytes)
* **EEDR** (EEPROM Data Register)
* **EECR** (EEPROM Control Register)

I believe two first registers are understandable for you. But the third register which is the EECR has to be explained more. EEPROM Control Register has 8 bits in which 4 of them are used by the microcontroller and is reserved. But the other 4 bits are known as:
* **EERE** (EEPROM Read Enable bit)
* **EEWE** (EEPROM Write Enable bit)
* **EEMWE** (EEPROM Master Write Enable bit)
* **EERIE** (EEPROM Read Interrup Enable bit)

The exact procedure of writing data into the EEPROM is as follows:
1. Wait untill the **EEWE** bit gets 0.
2. Wait untill the **SPMEN** bit in **SPMCR** gets 0.
3. Write the **new address** of EEPROM in which our data is going to be stored at.
4. Write the **new data** into the **EEDR**.
5. Write the **logical 1** into the **EEMWE** bit.
6. Write the **logical 1** into the **EEWE** in 4 cycles after turning the **EEMWE** 1.

## Calculating the addition of square of 5X numbers
In this coding procedure, I will show you how to find the addition of square of 5X numbers (5, 10, 15, 20 ...) and store them in the R1:R0 registers.
So the result will be something like (25 + 100 + 225 + 400 + ...)
