AVR ATmega16 Microcontroller programming and simulation using AtmelStudio and Proteus.

#Introduction: Instruction Set and Addressing Modes
The following is a quick start on basic concepts of ATmega16 microcontroller.

## Instruction Set
This is a set of instructions for ATmega16 microcontroller which decides what operations the microcontroller can perform. Each instruction can control some parts of microcontroller.

## Addressing Modes
Instructions can be categorized based on **how they access data** and **how they perform operations** on those data. This category consist of about 10 modes that controls this access and operation.

# Instruction Format
Each instruction in ATmega16 consists of two parts:
* Opcode: Indicates to ALU what to do.
* Operands: Numbers on which the ALU operates.
