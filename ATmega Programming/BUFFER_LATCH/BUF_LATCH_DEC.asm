; A program to connect 3 interact between the input of the buffers and 7-segments that are connected to the latches
; On each 7-seg, we will show the number of pressed key according to the buffer that has got the interrupt

start:

	ldi TEMP,0x00
	out DDRA,TEMP
	; To find the device that has made the interrupt
	; I'll connect the all ports of each device together in logical OR gate and connect the output of these 
	; 3 logical OR gates to the port C
	; So the PORT C will be used as input
	ldi TEMP,0x00
	out DDRC,TEMP
	; set the port b to output
	ldi TEMP,0b00000111
	out DDRB,TEMP
	; Enable all buffers
